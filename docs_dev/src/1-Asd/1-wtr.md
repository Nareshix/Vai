# 🐉🔥 Vai — The “Definitely Not The Next Hugo” Static Site Generator 🔥🐉

> *“A static site generator so slow, it time-traveled back to tell its past self to hurry up.”*
> *“Like Jekyll and Hugo had a kid… and immediately abandoned it.”*

Welcome to **Vai** — the most gloriously unnecessary Python static site generator you never wanted, asked for, or needed. But here we are. 🎉

---

## 🥳 What is Vai?

* A **Static Site Generator** built with 🐍 Python and the sheer force of bad decisions
* Definitely *not* Hugo. Not Jekyll. Not even close. It's... Vai. That’s it. That’s the pitch.
* Created during snack time 🍕, burnout 🍩, and that magical moment between “I should sleep” and “what if I reinvent the wheel but worse?”
* Generates *some* static sites. On a good day. With tailwinds. And prayers. 🤞
* Expect your site to look like a potato 🥔 that learned HTML in a dream
* For the brave, the reckless, and those whose debugging motto is “YOLO” 💀

## 🐲 Why Should You Even Try Vai?

* You enjoy watching progress bars that don’t move
* You want a tool that makes you feel smarter *every time you give up on it*
* You’ve always wanted to say, “This site took 5 hours and 3 existential crises to build.”
* You accidentally cloned it and now you're emotionally attached
* Supporting weird open source projects is your thing. Respect. 🫡
* Honestly, you just want to laugh. And maybe cry. But mostly laugh.

## 🛠️ How to Vai It Up 🔧🐢

1. Clone this miracle of modern mediocrity:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/absolutely-no-one/vai.git
cd vai
python3 vai.py
```

2. Watch in awe as nothing happens
3. Cry a little. Maybe a lot.
4. Consider going back to Notepad

## 🧪 Sample Code You’ll Totally Need For No Reason:

```javascript
console.log('hello'); // It begins
const test = document.querySelector('asd'); // Which does nothing. Like Vai.
```

```python
import random

def generate_random_numbers(count=10, start=1, end=100):
    return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]

def main():
    numbers = generate_random_numbers()
    print("Unsorted numbers:", numbers)
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    print("Sorted numbers:", sorted_numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

```
noithing  # A typo? A prophecy? Who knows.
```

`test`  # This does... something. Somewhere. Probably.

## 💀 Final Thoughts ;)

Vai isn’t just a static site generator. It’s a lifestyle. A poorly-optimized, buggy, deeply confusing lifestyle. But if you’ve made it this far… you're already one of us.

**Clone responsibly. Laugh uncontrollably. Vai eternally.**
