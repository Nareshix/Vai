# Styling

If you want to make changes to the website themes, styles and modify rules to certain elements, this page is for you

You should edit the `static/style.css` file. Do take note that it has over 1000 lines.

I recommend you to inspect the page for any changes you want to make and find out the `id/class` in the dev console and edit respective `id/class` functions accordingly. `Ctrl+f` is your good friend here
