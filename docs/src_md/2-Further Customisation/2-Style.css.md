# Welcome to Vai! 🥳

- This page (`1-welcome.md`) is just a placeholder.
- Feel free to edit it or replace it entirely with your own homepage content.
- You will mostly edit content in the `src_md/` directory.
-  We also have provided `static/` and `templates/` directory for more deeper and advanced customisation 😉
