# Markdown Syntax

We won't be teaching how to use the Markdown language. There are plenty of guides and videos on the internet. If you are looking for any recommendations, we recommend the basic syntax guide from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)


In this section, we'll explore a few features made specifc to `vai` that goes beyond standard Markdown syntax and they are

1. [Routing](#routing)
2. [Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting](#code-blocks-and-syntax-highlighting)
3. [Page Metadata](#page-metadata)
4. [Admonition Blocks](#admonition-blocks)

## Routing
---

### Table Of Content (TOC)
It is important to take note that `#`, `##`  and `###` in markdown files will be indexed in the table of container (TOC) on the righ column. using `###` will cause that header to be indented inwards, while `#` and `##` remains. This is often a useful visual indicator to show that there is a subheader for more information.

:::danger WARNING
although u can use multiple `#`, it is **VERY STRONGLY** recommended to only add one per page, and it should be at the top of the page. You should use this to indicate the main title of the page. This is good for SEO ranking. Whenever in doubt, just choose the title to be the same as the markdown file you created.
For example, if you have created a `1-Test.md` file, you should add `# Test` at the top of the md file

### How to link pages and headers?


#### Clean URL
When you create a header in your document (e.g., `## Page Metadata`), `vai` automatically generates a linkable ID for it by converting all the words to lowercase and spaces(` `) to dashes (`-`). For instance,  The header text `## Page Metadata` gets the **id** `page-metadata`.  

To link to a **header** for example, simply do this: 
```md
[Page Metadata](#page-metadata)
```

To link **across pages**, for example, simply do this:  

```md
[just an example](/introduction/what-is-vai/)
```

and you can **link accross pages to a header** via

```md
[just an example](/introduction/what-is-vai/#a-random-header)
```

:::info
 Vai uses a [`number-Name`](/introduction/getting-started/#source-code) folder structure. When linking to a first page of a section (e.g `1-introduction.md` for a directory), you can simply reference the directory name without specifying the first page name (`1-introduction.md`). Vai will automatically direct users to the first page in that directory.
:::

### How to link images?
To link images, you  **must** add your images inside of the static directory. When linking, you should link it via `/static/<file-name>`. For better organisation, it is **encouraged** to create a seperate directory (e.g. `images`) inside of the static directory to store your images and link them appropriately(e.g. `/static/images/<file-name>`).



## Page Metadata
---
`vai` currently supports only **2** page metadata and they are `title` and `date`.
Lets explain the simple syntax with a simple example below

```
+++
title: My Custom Page Title
date: January 1, 2024
+++

# Welcome to my page
...
```
:::tip TIP
If you only need one key, (`title` or `date`), include the one you want and leave out the other.
Let's go through what the 2 keys do
:::

### `title` 
![chrome tab](/static/images/chrome_tab.png)
It modifes the current tab name to anything you want. By leaving this out, it defaults to the `.md` file name. For instance, you are editing a `1-Markdown Syntax.md`. The title for your page would be `Markdown Syntax`.

### `date`


You can specify a specific date and this date will be shown in the `Last updated:` section in the bottom right of the page. Leaving this out defaults to the date u edited your markdown file and  convert it to html via `vai run` or `vai build`. The default date format would be DD-Month-YYYY 
(e.g.  `9th October 2009` )

:::info IMPORTANT
the values u put after `date` will be a string , meaning u can add any value (as long as it is a string) and it will be shown exactly in `Last updated`. it does not change dynamically and will have to be manually changed.

## Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting
---
### Code Block
All Code Blocks in `vai` has a `copy-and-paste` mechanism when hovered over. **Ensure** that you leave a line before and after the backticks (```).


### Syntax Highlighting
If you want to display code and support syntax highlighting we support it. You must use the fenced method for creating a code block (```) and **specify the language beside it**. We use [Pygemnts](https://pygments.org/) for syntax highlighting and it has support for over [100+ languages](https://pygments.org/languages/)


*Syntax Example* : 

![fenced python code](/static/images/fenced_python.png)

*Which gives us* :
```python
def func(name):
    print(f'hello {name}')
```

We also support syntax highlighting from [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) which also supports over [100+ languages](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html). If you would like to use their syntax highlighting simply tab (4 spaces) the full fenced code.

*Syntax Example* : 
![fenced python code with indentatoin](/static/images/fenced_python_with_tab.png)

*Which gives us* :

    ```python
    def func(name):
        print(f'hello {name}')
    ```
notice that the colours are slightly different.


### Code blocks inside of lists

If you want code blocks inside of list without breaking the structure, simply indent the code block by [two tabs](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code-blocks-1) (8 spaces) within the list item. All code blocks inside a list will strictly use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting


#### Code blocks with syntax highlighting
For `syntax highlighting`, use **fenced code blocks with backticks** (```) and specify the language after the opening backticks.


*Syntax Example* :
![highlight.js code in list](/static/images/fenced_code_with_highlight_2_tab.png)

*Which gives us* :


1. First list

            
        ```python
        def hug_me(name):
            print(f'Free hugs for {name} ðŸ¤—')
        ```

2. Second list

#### Code blocks without syntax highlighting
If you **donâ€™t want** `syntax highlighting`, **avoid using fenced code blocks** altogether. Else, the backtick would be shown in the code block

*Syntax Example* :
![code block withou syntax highlighting](/static/images/fenced_code_2_tab.png)


*Which gives us* :

1. first list

        
        Random code block ðŸ¤—    

2. second list


## Admonition Blocks (`:::`)
---

We provide a few pre-made admonition block u can use. the syntax for it is

```
## some random content

:::<admonition-type> <optional-name>

content

::: 

## more random content
```
- There **must** be nothing before and after the `:::`. In other words, you should leave a line before and after the `:::`
- **not specifying** a name will **default to the admonition's type name**

*Below is the list of premade blocks and their syntax* :
### 1. note

:::note
hello there
:::

:::details syntax

```
:::note
hello there
:::
```
:::

### 1a. note (custom single name)
:::note vai
hello there
:::

:::details syntax

```
:::note vai
hello there
:::
```
:::
### 1b. note (custom multiple name)
:::note welcome to VAI
hello there
:::

:::details syntax

```
:::note welcome to vai
hello there
:::
```
:::
---
**You can also do the custom naming for the admonition blocks below with the same syntax**

---
### 2. tip

:::tip
hello there
:::

:::details syntax

```
:::tip
hello there
:::
```
:::
